    // This program is a two-in-one tool that first calculates the area of a circle and then seamlessly transitions to calculate the area of a rectangle, all within a single execution. Here's how it works:
    // 1. It starts by taking the user's input for the radius of the circle.
    // 2. It calculates the area of the circle using the formula `Ï€ * radius^2`.
    // 3. It then proceeds to calculate the area of a rectangle, taking user inputs for its length and width.
    // 4. It calculates the area of the rectangle as `length * width`.
    // 5. Finally, it displays both the circle and rectangle areas to the user.
